Morten Bergsmo <br> Director of the Centre for International Law Research and Policy and Visiting Professor at Peking University Law School

A European international lawyer, Morten Bergsmo has served as an academic in China, Europe and North-America. He pioneered the equalisation of access to international law sources, consistently arguing that access should be open to increase professional equality among legal actors. He coined and developed several key concepts in the contemporary international criminal law discourse, such as 'positive complementarityâ€™, and has urged a greater engagement with international law capacity in China and India.
